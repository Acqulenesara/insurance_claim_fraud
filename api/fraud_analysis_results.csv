32.38,"The CatBoost model predicts a relatively high fraud probability (about 81%) but the combined score is moderate (32.4), indicating some suspicion but not conclusive evidence of fraud. The claim details show a major multi-vehicle collision with police involvement, witnesses, and a police report, which supports claim legitimacy. However, the relatively high injury claim amount and the nature of the incident warrant further verification. No extra documents have been provided yet to confirm or refute the suspicion.",final_decision,[],0
29.02,"The CatBoost model predicts a moderate fraud probability (about 72.5%) but the combined score is relatively low (29), indicating some suspicion but not strong evidence of fraud. The claim details show a major multi-vehicle collision with police involvement, witnesses, and a police report, which supports the claim's legitimacy. However, the absence of extra documents such as the police report copy or photos of the damage limits the ability to fully verify the claim. Given the moderate fraud prediction and lack of corroborating documents, further evidence is needed to conclude definitively.",final_decision,[],1
11.88,"The claim involves a minor front collision to a parked Ferrari with property damage but no bodily injury or witnesses, and no police report was filed. The CatBoost model predicts a low fraud probability (~29.7%) and rule-based score is zero, indicating no strong fraud signals from the data. However, the high claim amount ($50,000) for minor damage and absence of police report or witnesses warrant caution. Predictive analytics literature suggests that lack of corroborating evidence and high claim amounts in single-vehicle incidents can be risk factors, but the current data is insufficient to conclusively determine fraud.",final_decision,[],2
9.83,"The CatBoost model predicts a low fraud probability (approximately 24.6%) and classifies the claim as non-fraudulent, resulting in a combined low fraud score of about 9.8. The claim details indicate a minor front collision with property damage, police involvement, and a police report available, which supports claim legitimacy. The insured has a long customer history (60 months) and no bodily injuries or suspicious claim patterns are noted. No contradictory evidence or red flags are present in the current data.",accept,[],3
9.83,"The claim involves a single vehicle front collision with minor damage and no bodily injuries, supported by a police report and a witness. The CatBoost model predicts a low fraud probability (24.6%) and the combined score is low (9.8), indicating low suspicion of fraud. The insured has a long customer history (60 months) and a consistent profile. No contradictory or suspicious information is present in the current data.",accept,[],4
9.76,"The claim involves a single vehicle front collision with minor damage, police report available, and one witness. The insured has a long customer history (60 months) and no bodily injuries or prior fraud reported. The CatBoost model predicts a low fraud probability (24.4%) and combined score is low (9.76), indicating low likelihood of fraud. The claim amount ($10,000) is reasonable for the described damage and vehicle age. No suspicious patterns or inconsistencies are evident from the provided data.",accept,[],5
9.76,"The CatBoost model predicts a low fraud probability (24.4%) and classifies the claim as non-fraudulent. The claim details show a single-vehicle minor front collision with police involvement and a police report available, which supports legitimacy. The insured has a long customer history (60 months) and no bodily injuries or suspicious claim patterns. The total claim amount and split between property and vehicle claims appear consistent with the incident severity. No extra documents have been provided to further verify the claim, but current data and model output do not raise significant fraud concerns.",accept,[],6
11.55,"The claim involves a young, relatively new customer (6 months) with a high-value vehicle (2022 Lamborghini Huracan) reporting a total loss from a single-vehicle front collision on a remote highway at 2 AM, with no police report or witnesses. The CatBoost model predicts a low fraud probability (~29%) and rule-based score is zero, indicating no strong fraud signals from the data. However, the absence of authorities contacted and witnesses, combined with the high claim amount and the insured's unemployed status with a hobby of racing, slightly raise suspicion. Predictive analytics literature suggests that lack of corroborating evidence and unusual claim circumstances warrant further verification. Therefore, the fraud risk is low to moderate but not negligible.",final_decision,[],7
30.31,"The CatBoost model predicts a moderate likelihood of fraud with a fraud probability of approximately 0.76, but the combined score is relatively low at 30.3, indicating some risk but not strong evidence of fraud. The claim details show a major damage rear collision with police involvement, witnesses, and a police report, which supports claim legitimacy. However, the relatively high injury claim and total claim amount warrant further verification. No extra documents have been provided yet to confirm the claim details or detect inconsistencies.",final_decision,[],8
11.05,"The claim involves a single-vehicle front collision resulting in a total loss with police involvement and a police report available, which supports legitimacy. The insured has been a customer for 18 months with no prior fraud reported. The CatBoost model predicts a low fraud probability (27.6%) and classifies the claim as non-fraudulent. The claim details, including the presence of a witness and police report, align with typical genuine claims. However, the relatively high total claim amount ($45,000) and the vehicle's age (2008 Ford Focus) warrant some caution, but no strong fraud indicators are present based on current data.",accept,[],9
16.35,"The claim involves a 2024 Bugatti Chiron reported stolen in a remote area of Anchorage, AK, with a total loss and a high claim amount of $500,000. The CatBoost model predicts a low fraud probability (about 41%) and rule-based score is zero, resulting in a combined low fraud score (~16). The insured has a very long customer history and a high deductible, which may reduce incentive for fraud. However, the claim details alone are insufficient to conclusively assess fraud risk given the high value and complexity of the claim. Key documents such as the police report (FIR), proof of vehicle ownership, and evidence of theft circumstances are missing. These are critical to verify the legitimacy of the theft and the claim amount, especially for a luxury vehicle theft claim. Without these, a reliable fraud assessment cannot be made.",final_decision,[],10
